## Compatibility

Currently, this extension has been only tested on Chrome, but it may work on other browsers. 

## Known Issues

There are some issues currently in the extension, and are worked on currently in my free time.

### Colors of media inaccurate when dark mode is enabled

This is a major issue, the colors of media (images, videos, etc) aren't displayed quite accurately. I'm working on implementing a fix for this.

### Profile Icons without avatars are wrong the wrong color

This is a minor issue. The background color of the profile images that don't have a custom image set as avatar will displayed in inverted colors.
